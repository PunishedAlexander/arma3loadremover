# arma3-loadremover

This asl script removes loading times for ArmA 3.

# How to make it work

Edit your LiveSplit layout and add a Scriptable Auto Splitter.
Browse to the downloaded file and hit open you are done.
Make sure to disable Battleye in your launcher or else it will not work. (Its probably blocking it from reading the game memory?)
This will pause your timer not only during loading but also when saving or when you open the menu.

# Support

Works on 64bit, I do not know about 32bit but it should work.
